# CQRS

To build up to "what" CQRS is, I want to build up context with our warehouse
project as an example:
- introduce models and their relationships (article, inbound order)

## What is CQRS?
Command Query Responsibility Segregation

two models: one for reading (read model), one for writing (domain model)

## Why do we want to use CQRS?
What problem(s) does it solve?
