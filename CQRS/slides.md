# The *what* and *why* of CQRS
*..in IT Logistics Fashion*

---

## CQR.. what?

---

## Definition
<!-- .element: style="font-size: smaller; text-align: left;" -->

**CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation**, a pattern that
separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS in
your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security. The
flexibility created by migrating to CQRS allows a system to better evolve over
time and prevents update commands from causing merge conflicts at the domain
level.

Note:
- this is very boring
- instead let's take a step back and build up some context to better explain what CQRS is

---

Separate models for **reads** and **writes**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- very simple

Note:
- separate object models
- read and write models stored in different tables
- write model: validation of business logic and system constraints
- read model: serving requirements of views

---

Note:
- even though we now have separate models for reads and writes, it's still
  backed up by the same conceptual model
- the read model is just a different representation (e.g. aggregation of
  multiple entities)

---

## ..but why?

Note:
- why do we want to make the effort of maintaining two models

---

## Performance!

Note:
- usually more reads than writes
  - example: web shop
  - users view more offers than they place orders

## Tradeoffs

### Complexity üò±

### Consistency ?

## üëç

- domain model not compromised for reads
- scale reads and writes independently

---

## ü§î

- complexity üìà
- (eventual) consistency
