# Git workflows
*..for shaping your commit history*

<br>
<span style="font-size: smaller;">
Philipp Albrecht<br>
</span>

Note:
Hi guys and welcome to my talk!  
My name is Philipp and today I want to show you two techniques for shaping your
git commit history.

- I use these techniques very extensively
- They buy me a lot of flexibility and made my workflow more efficient

So let's dive right in!

---

## Why shape your commit history?  

Note:

- Why do we want to shape our commit history?  
- What is the benefit of a well shaped commit history?

---

## Commit history = context

Note:
- Your commit history is a vehicle to transport context for your changes.
- The changes themselves represent the "what", whereas the commit history represents the *why*
- Context can be helpful
	- for your future self (if you have to debug a bug that is 3 months old)
	- and of course in code reviews
		- providing good context will speed up reviews a lot
		- this makes you more efficient as a team

Side note_: commit messages are one key aspect of a good commit history, but I
will not talk about how to write good commit messages today. Fawad already
covered this topic extensively in his tech talk, so please check it out!

- When I was new to git, creating meaningful self-contained commits was really
	hard for me.
- The point, where I was ready to commit my work, usually was *after* I've done
	all my changes.
- Let's look at an example of fixing a but to show you how this might look like.

---

## Fixing a bug  

1. Dive into the bug related code 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
2. This variable name could be better, I‚Äôll rename that! üöÄ
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
3. Oh, I could extract that method here. Great! üöÄ
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. Done! Oh, cleaning up code feels so good ü§§
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
5. Fix the actual bug üèÜ
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:
1. First you start reading the code related to the bug, getting an idea of what is going on.
2. On your way through the code base you - of course- spot some code smells.
	 Being a good boyscout you refactor a little here and there feeling good
	 about yourself, because you're leaving the code a cleaner place than it was
	 before.
3. Then you find the bug and manage to fix it.

----

6. Damn, tests failing because of my refactoring..
7. Just need to rewrite these test cases a little üîß
8. Tests passing!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
9. Finally..
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
	```shell
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m ‚ÄúFix bug‚Äù
	$ git push
	```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Note:
1. Nope, some tests are failing because of your refactoring. You rewrite a few bits and hooray..
2. ..tests are passing.
3. Finally, you commit your changes, push and request a review from your colleague.

And here's the problem..

---

![not cool bro](img/not-cool-bro.png)

Note:
- At this point, my work tree is full of changes.
- Looking back, I realize that besides fixing the bug, I also did some refactoring.
- So I want to separate refactoring from the actual bugfix in my commits.
- But how?
- We can do better than git add .

</div>

Notes:
- Let's say we have four files.
- Instead of staging all changes, we could stage single files.  
- But this is also very limitting
 
- What if I want to only commit some parts of a single file?
- What if a commit should span different parts of multiple files?

---

## Interactive hunk staging
*git add --patch*

Note:

- Git breaks down your changes into so called "hunks" 
- and lets you interactively decide which parts of your changes you want to add to the index.
- This gives you a chance to review the difference before adding modified contents to the index.

So let me show you how this works.

---

<!-- .element: data-visibility="hidden" -->

```diff[]
$ git add --patch












```

Note:
Git splits up your changes into so called "hunks" and asks you what you want to do with it.

This gives the user a chance to review the difference before adding modified
contents to the index.

q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones
a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
e - manually edit the current hunk
? - print help
```

<div class="fragment" style="font-size: smaller;">
Configure your editor of choice

```shell
$ git config --global core.editor "nvim"
```
</div>

Note:
Among other options, you can for example say:
1. yes, I want to stage this hunk
2. no, I don't want to stage this hunk
3. I want to manually edit the hunk before staging it
4. For this you might want to configure your editor of choice, otherwise git
	 will use your shell's default editor, which could be vi or vim. And then you
	 would have to google how to exit vim, and so on. So take away: configure
	 your editor of choice!

## Workflow recap

<span class="fragment" style="text-decoration: line-through;">Commit early, commit often.</span>

1. Hack out code like crazy!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Decide about commit boundaries in retrospect
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Create commits with
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
```text
$ git add --patch
```
4. Practice 1. - 3.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. Commit early, commit often

## Interactive rebasing
*git rebase --interactive*

---

## Rewrite history

- Reword commit messages
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Reorder commits
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Squash commits
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Delete commits
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Isnt' that awesome! You can play fucking God!

Note:
You can fix your past mistakes and nobody will ever know!
But with great power comes great responsibility..

---

**Don‚Äôt push your work until you‚Äôre happy with it!**  
<!-- .element: style="text-align: left" -->

One of the cardinal rules of Git is that, since so much work is local within
your clone, you have a great deal of freedom to rewrite your history locally.
However, once you push your work, it is a different story entirely, and you
should consider pushed work as final unless you have good reason to change it.
In short, you should avoid pushing your work until you‚Äôre happy with it and
ready to share it with the rest of the world.
<!-- .element: style="font-size: smaller; text-align: left" -->

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History
<!-- .element: style="font-size: small; text-align: right" -->

Note:
Generally you should not rewrite history you already pushed. Especially if
other people are relying on that history. Why? I leave that as an exercise for
you to find out.

Feel free to read this giant block of text after the talk. I will make my
slides available on Slack.

So, let's walk through a short example of an interactive rebase.

Note:
1. Here we have 6 commits **STEP**
2. Again, it's about fixing a bug, which is represented by this commit **STEP**
3. As you can see, we have a lot of refactoring commits (extract method, etc.) **STEP**

We realize that the refactoring commits are pretty small on their own, so we
want to combine all our refactoring commits into one single commit.

So the goal is to have a resulting commit history like this **STEP**

Here we have just two commits:
1. one for the bugfix
2. and the other one for refactoring, where we keep the information about each
	 refactoring in the commit message
